**CBD and You**

# Website

This website is aimed at educating users about the usages and benefits of CBD. CBD alone is a strong substance that allows for health/regenerative effects that the body can use to combat stress and discomfort. 

The website will be hosted at [GitHub] (file:///Users/sampandey/Documents/GitHub/MyWebsite-Project/Website%20Project.html).

## Purpose

The purpose of the website of the website is to provide a list of CBD products that individuals can explore and locate near them. 

The functionality of the website utilizes [Google] Maps and allows the user to locate where the products near them could be "potentailly," located. 

# Organization

The organization of the website includes a main page with the map feature and three additional webpages access through a horizontal navigation bar. 

It originally had a functioning Google Maps API integrated on the landing page that allowed for the user to drop a pin at their location but I have not since succeded in doing so.
